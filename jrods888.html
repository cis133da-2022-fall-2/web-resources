    <p> The HTML resource that I found most helpful so far, is Free Code Camp, found at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-crash-course/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-crash-course/</a>. Most of this is completely new to me, so understanding the breakdown of HTML is paramount, and this website did a great job of explaining that. Elements, tags, attributes, and how they work is clearly defined and helped me understand some of the lingo involved as well. There is a video that links to youtube that does a good job of explaining basic elements of HTML as well. </p>
    <p> The CSS resource I found to help my understanding most is found at https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-tutorial. The site does a good job of explaining the differences between CSS and HTML as well as explaining when to use CSS opposed to HTML. How to link CSS code to HTML is also an important aspect that is covered. </p>
