      I think this resource for learning HTML is great beacause the tutorial is
      well organized and it is also raw and basically gives and O.G perspective
      explanation on how to learn since it is by Mozilla.

      I also think Mozilla gives a great basic tutorial on getting started with
      a stylesheet. They even have a nice picture at the end of the tutorial
      that shows a very neat looking page displaying how cool Mozilla is with
      the Firefox logo in nice big print and matching colors of the logo
      throught the page.
